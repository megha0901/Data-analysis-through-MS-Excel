# Data-analysis-through-MS-Excel
In this project, I cleaned and formatted data in MS Excel, and created interactive charts to visually represent and analyze monthly trends for various products, resulting in an informative and user-friendly dashboard.
Data Clarity: The data cleaning and formatting processes ensure that the information is accurate, consistent, and free from errors. This guarantees that stakeholders are working with reliable data, minimizing the risk of making decisions based on flawed information.
Real-time Monitoring: With the interactive dashboard, stakeholders can monitor product performance on a monthly basis in real-time. This is especially beneficial for making timely adjustments or capitalizing on emerging trends, which can ultimately lead to increased profitability.
Enhanced Communication: The project's visual elements facilitate better communication among team members and stakeholders. Complex data can be conveyed more easily and is open to interpretation by a wider audience.
